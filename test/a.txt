The diff utility was developed in the early 1970s
on the Unix operating system
which was emerging from AT&T Bell Labs
in Murray Hill, New Jersey.
The final version, first shipped with the 5th Edition
of Unix in 1974,
was entirely written by Douglas McIlroy.
This research was published in a 1976 paper
co-written with James W. Hunt who developed
an initial prototype of diff.[2]
The algorithm this paper described became
known as the Huntâ€“McIlroy algorithm.

McIlroy's work was preceded and influenced
by Steve Johnson's comparison
program on GECOS and Mike Lesk's proof program.
proof also originated on Unix and,
like diff, produced line-by-line changes
and even used angle-brackets
(">" and "<") for presenting line
insertions and deletions in
the program's output.
The heuristics used in these early applications were,
however, deemed unreliable.
The potential usefulness of a diff tool
provoked McIlroy into researching
and designing a more robust tool that could
be used in a variety of tasks
but perform well in the processing
and size limitations of the PDP-11's hardware.
His approach to the problem resulted from
collaboration also with individuals
at Bell Labs including Alfred Aho,
Elliot Pinson, Jeffrey Ullman, and Harold S. Stone.
