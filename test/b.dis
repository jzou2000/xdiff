Below is a summary of all of the options that GNU diff  accepts.  Most
options have two equivalent names, one of which is a single letter pre-
ceded by -, and the other of which is a long name preceded by --. 
Single letter options (unless they take an argument) can be com-
bined into a single command line word: -ac  is  equivalent  to  -a  -c.
Long  named  options  can  be abbreviated to any unique prefix of their
name.  Brackets ([ and ]) indicate that an  option  takes  an  optional
argument.

-lines Show  lines (an integer) lines of context.  This option does not
       specify an output format by itself; it has no effect  unless  it
       is combined with -c or -u.  This option is obsolete.  For proper
       operation, patch typically needs at least two lines of context.

-a     Treat  all  files as text and compare them line-by-line, even if
       they do not seem to be text.
